# Full Stack Development Test - Week Two

This assessment tests your understanding of classes, testing, HOFs and list-type data structures.

## Guidelines

- The resources you may use online are:
  - [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
  - [Chai docs](https://www.chaijs.com/api/)
- Make sure you give yourself a grade before turning it in!

## Tips

- Use your whiteboard to draw the problem.
- Write pseudocode before writing code.

## Steps to run the test

```bash
yarn
yarn test
```

## Self-Assessment

Give yourself a grade for each question. Explain why you gave yourself that grade.

| Grade | Explanation                                                        |
